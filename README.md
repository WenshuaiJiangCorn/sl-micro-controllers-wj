## Detailed Description

This library builds on top of the general architecture defined by the 
[ataraxis-micro-controller](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller) library to implement the hardware
modules used in the Sun lab. This project is explicitly designed and built to work with the hardware made and used in 
the lab, and will likely not work in other contexts without extensive modification. It is made public to serve as the 
real-world example of how to use 'Ataraxis' libraries to acquire scientific data.

Note, the rest of this ReadMe assumes familiarity with the procedures, experiments, and tools used in the Sun lab
to acquire scientific data. See our [publications](https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/publications) before reading 
further, if you are not familiar with the work done in the lab.

Currently, we use three microcontrollers as part of our behavior data acquisition pipeline: AMC-ACTOR, AMC-SENSOR, and 
AMC-ENCODER. The Actor is used to interface with the hardware modules that control the experiment environment, for 
example, to deliver water, lock running wheel, and activate Virtual Reality screens. The Sensor is used to monitor most 
data-acquisition devices, such as torque sensor, lick sensor, and Mesoscope frame timestamp sensor. The Encoder uses 
hardware interrupt logic to monitor the animal’s movement at a high frequency and resolution, which is necessary to
properly update the Virtual Reality world used to facilitate experiments in the lab. Using this combination of 
microcontrollers maximizes the data acquisition speed while avoiding communication channel overloading.

This project contains both the schematics for assembling the microcontrollers used in the lab and the code that runs on
these microcontrollers. The hardware created and programmed as part of this project is designed to be interfaced through
the bindings available from the [sl-experiment](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-experiment) library, which is a core
dependency for every Sun lab project.

## Hardware Assembly

To assemble the microcontroller hardware, consult the 
[schematics and instructions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12gDWwI_88usMgt7qVo7e83FKYo45KZwz?usp=drive_link)
reflecting the latest state of our microcontroller hardware.

Note, the provided link only covers the microcontrollers and does not discuss the assembly of other 
experiment-facilitating devices, such as the treadmill system or visual recording systems. Consult the main 
[sl-experiment](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-experiment) library or previous lab publications for details on 
assembling other data acquisition system components.

## Software Installation

1. Download this repository to a local PC with direct USB access to the microcontrollers. Use the latest
   stable release from [GitHub](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controllers/releases), as it always 
   reflects the current state of our data acquisition hardware.
2. Open the project in the 'Platformio' IDE.
3. Connect a ***single*** microcontroller to the host PC and select the microcontroller type by modifying the 
   preprocessor directive on line 26 of the [main.cpp](src/main.cpp). Do ***NOT*** connect more than a single controller
   at a time, as some systems have issues selecting the correct upload target otherwise.
4. After uploading the code, disconnect the microcontroller from the host-PC and connect the next microcontroller.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all microcontrollers are configured.
6. Connect all microcontrollers to the PC that will manage the data acquisition runtime (in our case, the VRPC).

## Usage

Once the microcontrollers are assembled, configured, and connected to the VRPC, they can be accessed via the 
[sl-experiment](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-experiment) library.
