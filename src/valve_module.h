/**
 * @brief Sends digital signals to dispense precise amounts of fluid via the managed solenoid valve.
 *
 * This module is specifically designed to send digital signals that trigger Field-Effect-Transistor (FET) gated relay
 * hardware to deliver voltage that opens or closes the controlled valve. Depending on configuration, this module is
 * designed to work with both Normally Closed (NC) and Normally Open (NO) valves.
 *
 * @note This class was calibrated to work with fluid valves that deliver micro-liter-precise amounts of fluid under
 * gravitational driving force. The current class implementation may not work as intended for other use cases.
 * Additionally, the class is designed for dispensing predetermined amounts of fluid and not for continuous flow rate
 * control, which would require a PWM-based approach similar to the one used by the BreakModule class.
 *
 * @tparam kPin the digital pin connected to the valve's FET-gated relay.
 * @tparam kNormallyClosed determines whether the managed valve is opened or closed when unpowered. This is
 * used to adjust the class behavior so that toggle OFF always means the valve is closed and toggle ON means the
 * valve is open.
 * @tparam kStartClosed determines the initial state of the valve during class initialization. This works
 * together with kNormallyClosed parameter to deliver the desired initial voltage level for the valve to either be
 * opened or closed after hardware initialization.
