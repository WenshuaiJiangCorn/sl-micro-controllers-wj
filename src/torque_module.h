 * @brief The header-only file for the TorqueModule class. This class allows interfacing with a torque sensor to
 * monitor the torque applied to the connected object.
 *
 * @attention Since most torque sensors output a differential signal to code for the direction of the torque, this
 * class is designed to work with an AD620 microvolt amplifier to straighten and amplify the output of the torque
 * sensor.
 *
 * @section trq_mod_dependencies Dependencies:
 * - Arduino.h for Arduino platform functions and macros and cross-compatibility with Arduino IDE (to an extent).
 * - digitalWriteFast.h for fast digital pin manipulation methods.
 * - module.h for the shared Module class API access (integrates the custom module into runtime flow).
 * - shared_assets.h for globally shared static message byte-codes and parameter structures.

/**
 * @brief Monitors the signal sent by the torque sensor through an AD620 microvolt amplifier.
 *
 * This module is specifically designed to work with fine-resolution torque signals that output differential signals
 * in the millivolt or microvolt range that is picked up and amplified by the AD620 amplifier. This module works by
 * monitoring an analog input pin for the signal from the AD620 amplifier expected to be zeroed ~ 1.6 V. This way,
 * torque in the CW direction is detected as a positive deflection from baseline, and torque in the CCW direction
 * is detected as a negative deflection from baseline. The class can be flexibly configured to report torque in either
 * direction and to only report significant torque changes.
 *
 * @tparam kPin the analog pin whose state will be monitored to detect torque's direction and magnitude.
 * @tparam kBaseline the value, in ADC units, for the analog signal sent by the sensor when it detects no torque. This
 * value depends on the zero-point calibration of the AD620 amplifier, and it is used to shift differential bipolar
 * signal of the torque sensor to use a positive integer scale. Signals above baseline are interpreted as ClockWise
 * (CW) torque, and signals below the baseline are interpreted as CounterClockWise (CCW) torque.
 * @tparam kInvertDirection if true, inverts the direction the torque returned by the sensor. By default, the sensor
 * interprets torque in the CW direction as positive and torque in the CCW direction as negative. This flag allows
 * reversing this relationship, which may be helpful, depending on how the sensor is mounted and wired.
